"""
Generator of quasiconsensustrees trees: 

quasiconsensustrees(...) 

Parameters, all optional: 
   - count - how many trees; default=1; -1, is infinite
   - cleanunused is set, then the networks will be cleaned
   - genetreessimilarity - between 0.0 (random trees) - 1.0 (clusters from gene trees), default is 0.7

Used variables from command line option:
- preserverootst
- guideclusters 
- guidetree 

Returns a generator of quasi-consensus trees 
Note that reading more one time may produce different results
Requires: defined species (e.g., via genetrees, -A, -G, -g, or setspecies)
